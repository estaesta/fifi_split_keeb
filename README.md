The Fifi keyboard, named after my [🐶](assets/fifi.gif), is a split keyboard with 3x5 column staggered keys and 3 thumb keys, based on foostan's mini-[crkbd](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/) schematic and thomasbaart's [kyria](https://github.com/splitkb/kyria) layout.

The goal of this project was to build a split keyboard that fits perfectly for the [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) layout with the minimalist style of mini-crkbd and have the aggressive column staggered keys found in kyria. The PCB is reversible, meaning you'll need two of the same PCB to create a full keyboard. It is my first attempt in PCB board design.
